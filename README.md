# recyclarr-gui
A "Nice" GUI for Recyclarr written in Python.

## Why?
While using recyclarr is straight forward and cmdline is easy to use, the massive configuration options and complexitiy of the YAML files to get it configured the way you want is something left to be desired.

## TODO
- [ ] Get local installation if there is already one; Process the current configuration files.
- [ ] Create a config page for basic configuration - ex. configuring servers to update
- [ ] Create a Setup page using Stepper Elements to start from scratch without recyclarr installed.
## Long Term TODO
- [ ] Advanced config page options such as allow mutliple different configurations such as split YAML files, custom files for each instance/server, etc.
